# Gorok - Retro-Style First-Person Controller
This is a first person controller setup in the style of Turok, Quake and other retro shooters.
Its is one of the first coded projects I have done and as a result the code can be bit of a mess,
however it works well enough with little issues. At the time of its creation, I did not release this
to public because I was not happy with the idea of releasing a project that is not finished and it
is after all one of my first projects in the engine, however time has passed and this project has been
sitting in my files collecting dust and after getting a few comments asking for the files, I decided to
release it to the public so at least people who want to use it can utilize it in their projects.

## Will I continue maintaining this project?
I do not plan to maintain this project and while I may use this in the future, I currently have no plans
to use this to create a full game and is the reason why I released it: I may not have a use for this
but someone on the internet could find a use for it in their project. If you ever use this first person
setup, please do share your project and how you have utilized this :D
